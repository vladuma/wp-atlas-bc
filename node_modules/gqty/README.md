> GQty is a fully-featured GraphQL client, which lowers the barrier of entry towards using GraphQL.

Data requirements within your application are picked up automatically, freeing you from having to maintain GraphQL queries by-hand. It offers a first-class TypeScript experience. See API documentation at all times within autocomplete.

Make breaking changes to your API, and see type-errors exactly where things are breaking, in realtime. No more running a separate validation step.

**More documentation is available at [gqty.dev/docs/getting-started](https://gqty.dev/docs/getting-started).**
